# NOSTR Machines - Sensors

## 3: A Nostr remote sensor
A client implementation to collect and send data over Nostr, and better, selling the data for satoshis! Imagine an array of sensors collecting data and automatically selling it to any human or AI in need of that information. ThatÂ´s what we propose here! ( a work in progress );

Sensors implemented:
* Distance:
	- Lidar - TFMiniPlus
	- Ultrasound - US-100 Y401
* Temperature/Humidity
	- DHT22
	- AHT0X
* Pluviometric
	- Bascar 0.25mm

Boards tested:
* ESP32-WROOM
* TTGO-Oled
* Heltec Lora32 V3 & V2	
* esp32-s3-devkitc-1
